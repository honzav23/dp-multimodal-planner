Jiří Hynek, Ph.D. It is a multimodal transport planner that allows to create routes that combine automobile and public transport. This application is suitable, for example, for people who commute to work or for tourists. The open source application OpenTripPlanner 2 is used to calculate the routes. Delay data and routes for individual legs are obtained from the Lissy application.",
